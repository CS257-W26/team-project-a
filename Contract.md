python aquastat.py —timePointYears “1970”
Would give all data for counties that was recorded in the year 1970

I don’t think I’m currently familiar enough with CLIs to say I can confirmedly say what has been the most helpful aspect of the guidelines but just the listing of commands and what they do, as well as giving examples, if by far the most helpful thing for me in general.

# Roles

## Sprint 1
* Organizer: Lloyd
* Gluer: Jay
* Researcher: Jay
* Ambassador: Paul
* Note-taker: Lloyd

## Sprint 2
* Organizer: Paul
* Gluer: Lloyd
* Researcher: Lloyd
* Ambassador: Jay
* Note-taker: Paul

## Plan for subsequent sprints
Stick with same roles from sprint 2 or continue to rotate?
Hopefully we will settle upon a dynamic we all enjoy so we don't need to keep switching.

Weekends as needed, time to be communicated, 4th floor of Libe

## Drop-in hour options

# Communication

Lloyd Stohler - 314 327 6698
Paul - 213 603 0914

* Email is also to be used.
* Meetings need to be attended by all participants (unless decided otherwise communaly)

# Conflict resolution
* If a member fails to meet their responsibilities or our agreed-upon standards, we will first address the issue through group discussion. Should the problem persist despite our internal efforts, we will then seek further help from Anya.
* Before a solo decision is to be made, it must be communicated.
* Any conflit or disagreements will be resolved with a collective consensus after discussion. We strongly encourage and value communication with respect.
