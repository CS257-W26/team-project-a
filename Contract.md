# Conflict resolution
* If a member fails to meet their responsibilities or our agreed-upon standards, we will first address the issue through group discussion. Should the problem persist despite our internal efforts, we will then seek further help from Anya.
* Before a solo decision is to be made, it must be communicated.
* Any conflit or disagreements will be resolved with a collective consensus after discussion. We strongly encourage and value communication with respect.
